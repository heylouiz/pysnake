# PySnake

![screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true)

Simple [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) implementation in Python.

I made this project while I was bored and to learn about [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## How to run

### Install pygame
`pip install pygame`

### Run with Python
`python pygame.py`


## How to play

Use arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat the apples, everytime the snake eats an apple it grows.
The snake dies and the game ends when the snake collide with itself or with the screen borders.

At the moment there are no points or menus, just a line traveling on your screen :)
